Aaron lecture - debugging
Bugs = unexpected behavior
* think about what you expected to happen...
* console log
* look for errors
* more eyes on it
* talk it our loud (rubber duck)
* Try these:

JS has a built in error constructor
`var myError = new Error('This is the first error.');`

throw keyword -- acts like an error

`debugger;` -- script runs to statement and stops running at that line

## Code Review (aaron)
Rachael's bus mall.
She used a recursive function, and it was effective. It acts like a while loop. But generally, it's not a good idea.


## TIPS
Atom editor - type HTML and tab... it fills in an HTML skeleton
