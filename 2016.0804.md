###Aaron - prototypes, etc.
Learn to understand these thoroughly:
- prototypes and inheritance (Objects)
    - anything stored on prototype isn't on the instance itself... it's on the prototype
    - when you see a double underscore in the console, don't touch it. It's not meant to be used.
- scopes and closures (functions)
- pass by reference vs. pass by value (variables)
    - Objects are passed by reference; Everything else is NOT passed by reference
- context / this keyword (context)

delete keyword -- used to remove a property


###Brian lecture

tips:
- html data attribute
- http://placehold.it/200x70/949504  (hex color value)
- `.inner > img`  (direct child)

Advice: Do the html structure first. Watch indenting. Make clean code. Do the css top to bottom. Work thru steadily, don't tweak. Get it looking close to good. Then tweak.

Responsive Design
css settings use % instead of px
we no longer code static sites -- we have a single code base that allows page to respond

To address text boxes that overflow -- `overflow: auto;``
