##function declaration and function expression

```
//declaration
woo(); // Can be run before function is declared - because the browser loads declared functions into memory before running the script. That's why you can call the function before it is declared in the script.

function woo() {
  alert('WOOOO!!!!!!!!');
}

///////////////////
// expression - doesn;t load into memory right away, therefore uses less memory. * }; semi-colon is necessary due to assignment operator.

notSoWoo(); // WOULD NOT RUN;

var notSoWoo = function() {
  alert('meh');
};

notSoWoo() // WOULD RUN
```

4. functionality guts
  - select 3 random pics from array of pic objects
    - compare vs previous 3
    - if dupe, reroll
