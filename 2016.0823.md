##Git and Terminal
* <!-- CH 6 - _Learn Git in a Month of Lunches_ -->
  - echo "a=1" >> math.text    adds a line to eof
  - cat math.txt     print file in terminal
  - git diff    compare files (between working area and staging area)
  - git diff --staged     (between the staging area and the repository)
  - git commit -a -m "This is the second commit."   add and commit. You do have to add the file first (with an initial git add) before this shortcut can work. The -a switch to git commit says to automatically stage (run git add) any files that Git knows about.
  - git add --dry-run .	Show what git add would do
  - git log --shortstat --oneline	Show history using one line per commit, and listing each file changed per commit
